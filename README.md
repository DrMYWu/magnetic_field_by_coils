# magnetic field generated by DC coils
Numerically solve for the magnetic field generated by the coil. A cylindrical coordinate system is used.
All units are in the International System.
Just run the MATLAB program directly.
The detailed solution process can be seen in the PDF document.
Here we use four identical and equally spaced coils, each with a current of 500A*100 (100 turns).
